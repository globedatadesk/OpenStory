by each resident that requested a tree. The current owner on record with the City of Boston for 3 Chamblet St is April Washington. The petition that the BPRD received has April Washington name  address and signature requesting trees to be planted in front of this location. As a result of this petition the street was inspected for new trees to be planted. It was then found that two trees could be planted at this location. At the time of the inspection a green door hanger was left behind stating the site was inspected for a new tree to be planted. This Spring a letter was also sent by the BPRD to the owner of 3 Chamblet St  April Washington that stated a tree would be planted at this location. April Washing also called the BPRD this morning and spoke with one of the Arborists who explained to her why the trees were being planted and how she had requested and signed a petition requesting the trees.

The homeowner of 147 Ashmont did not want a tree planted in front of their home. The resident then requested that public works come and close the tree pit. The first step in making a site safe and closing a pit is to fill the whole with asphalt and to make the site not a trip hazard anymore. If you have any questions regarding the permenant repair of the sidewalk please contact public works.,New Tree Requests,Parks & Recreation Department,Trees,New Tree Requests,PARK_New Tree Requests,PARK,,,145 Ashmont St  Dorchester  MA  02124,8,7,4,C11,Dorchester,8,Ward 17,1711,R1,145 Ashmont St,2124,Address,5324,42.2851,-71.0656,Self Service,"(42.2851, -71.0656)"1.01001E+11,6/20/14 16:27,6/9/16 16:27,9/23/14 10:59,2014,ONTIME,Closed,Case Closed Case Resolved Unable to plant  sidewalk not ADA compliant.,New Tree Requests,Parks & Recreation Department,Trees,New Tree Requests,PARK_New Tree Requests,PARK,,,37 Bailey St  Dorchester  MA  02124,8,7,4,C11,Dorchester,8,Ward 17,1711,R3,37 Bailey St,2124,Address,7522,42.2837,-71.0683,Self Service,"(42.2837, -71.0683)"1.01001E+11,6/23/14 8:51,6/12/16 8:51,2/18/15 13:52,2015,ONTIME,Closed,Case Closed Case Resolved Planted by Leahy landscaping fall 2014  under warranty until fall 2016,New Tree Requests,Parks & Recreation Department,Trees,New Tree Requests,PARK_New Tree Requests,PARK,,,1535 Washington St  Roxbury  MA  02118,4,1C,2,D4,Roxbury,6,9,901,E,1535 Washington St,2118,Address,341541,42.3397,-71.0736,Employee Generated,"(42.3397, -71.0736)"1.01001E+11,6/23/14 15:33,6/12/16 15:33,11/23/14 8:11,2014,ONTIME,Closed,Case Closed Case Resolved duplicaye,New Tree Requests,Parks & Recreation Department,Trees,New Tree Requests,PARK_New Tree Requests,PARK,,,100 Fulton St  Boston  MA  02109,3,1B,1,A1,Downtown / Financial District,3,Ward 3,301,CD,100 Fulton St,2109,Address,61258,42.3628,-71.0529,Self Service,"(42.3628, -71.0529)"1.01001E+11,6/24/14 13:40,6/13/16 13:40,2/17/15 14:17,2015,ONTIME,Closed,Case Closed Case Resolved Planted by Leahy landscaping fall 2014  under warranty until fall 2016,New Tree Requests,Parks & Recreation Department,Trees,New Tree Requests,PARK_New Tree Requests,PARK,,,266 Bunker Hill St  Charlestown  MA  02129,3,1A,1,A15,Charlestown,2,Ward 2,205,CM,266 Bunker Hill St,2129,Address,23438,42.3799,-71.0648,Constituent Call,"(42.3799, -71.0648)"1.01001E+11,6/24/14 15:44,6/13/16 15:44,2/18/15 11:57,2015,ONTIME,Closed,Case Closed Case Resolved Planted by Leahy landscaping fall 2014  under warranty until fall 2016,New Tree Requests,Parks & Recreation Department,Trees,New Tree Requests,PARK_New Tree Requests,PARK,,,23 S Fairview St  Roslindale  MA  02131,9,6,5,E5,Roslindale,10,Ward 20,2004,CM,23 S Fairview St,2131,Address,55916,42.2876,-71.1322,Constituent Call,"(42.2876, -71.1322)"1.01001E+11,6/25/14 10:09,6/14/16 10:09,2/17/15 11:49,2015,ONTIME,Closed,Case Closed Case Resolved Planted by Leahy landscaping fall 2014  under warranty until fall 2016,New Tree Requests,Parks & Recreation Department,Trees,New Tree Requests,PARK_New Tree Requests,PARK,,,2 Marlborough St  Boston  MA  02116,4,1C,8,D4,Back Bay,14,Ward 5,506,CM,2 Marlborough St,2116,Address,90619,42.3543,-71.0725,Employee Generated,"(42.3543, -71.0725)"1.01001E+11,6/25/14 10:21,6/14/16 10:21,2/18/15 9:20,2015,ONTIME,Closed,Case Closed Case Resolved Planted by Leahy landscaping fall 2014  under warranty until fall 2016,New Tree Requests,Parks & Recreation Department,Trees,New Tree Requests,PARK_New Tree Requests,PARK,,,20 Roseland St  Dorchester  MA  02124,8,7,3,C11,Dorchester,8,Ward 16,1603,E,20 Roseland St,2124,Address,118394,42.2914,-71.0636,Constituent Call,"(42.2914, -71.0636)"1.01001E+11,6/25/14 10:38,6/14/16 10:38,,,ONTIME,Open,,New Tree Requests,Parks & Recreation Department,Trees,New Tree Requests,PARK_New Tree Requests,PARK,,,1112 Blue Hill Ave  Dorchester  MA  02124,8,7,4,B3,Greater Mattapan,9,Ward 14,1412,C,1112 Blue Hill Ave,2124,Address,16171,42.2863,-71.0904,Employee Generated,"(42.2863, -71.0904)"1.01001E+11,6/25/14 15:55,6/14/16 15:55,9/16/14 8:45,2014,ONTIME,Closed,Case Closed Case Noted The sidewalk is not ADA compliant and a new tree can not be planted at this location.
